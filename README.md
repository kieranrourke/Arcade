The arcade currently features SpaceInvaders and Pong.       
The games use the python library pygame to display graphics and manage sounds.

The Pygame library is also required.                    
To install run:

<pre><code> pip install pygame </code></pre>



Usage 
---------
To run the program you must run the main.py file
