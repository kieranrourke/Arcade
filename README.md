Description

Personal Project to create and Arcade that has different games.
The arcade currently features SpaceInvaders.
The games use the python library pygame to display graphics and manage sounds.

SpaceInvaders: 

Space Invaders is an arcade game intilaly released in 1978. In this version there is currently 
only one type of enemy that spawns near the top of the screen and makes it's way down the screen
while moving side to side. Using the keys A and D the user can move the player side to side and 
using spacebar can shoot a laser at the enemy. If the enemy is hit one point is added to the score
shown in the top left. The game features a menu that the user can navigate using W and S as well 
as the enter key to enter a menu along with the escape key and backspace to return to the main menu.
The sub menus are New Game which enters a game with the chosen difficulty by default is easy, 
Choose Difficulty that allows the user to pick between Easy Medium and Hard levels,
Highscores which shows the top 10 highscores on the users machine,
Help which shows the controls

Once a game has been finished the user will be prompted to enter their name on the screen once the name 
is entered the user must hit enter and the game will reload to the main menu and the highscore will be 
saved.
